# Python2Abaqus-Automation
We will be learning the scripting via python. This repo contains files that can be used to under automate the modelling problems in mechanics at hand.   <br />

As a FEA trainer, we are well aware that the most of our time is spent on the model development (50 to 60 %). Any design automation that can identify the input parameters for the model generation and runs ib backend, postprocess the results greatly simplify our day 2 day task. We have attempted here to explain some of the structural problems.


 
Few important keywords are used in Abaqus for model generation.

Tutorial 1 - Bending of studs under wind pressure loading  <br />
Tutorial 2 - Cord-rubber bending over the pulley <br />
Tutorial 3 - Modeling of metamaterials <br />
